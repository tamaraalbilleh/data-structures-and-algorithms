## Approach & Efficiency
with an if statement decided weather the array length is even or odd , then accordingly to that decided the index placement of the value provided to be put in ,then using a for loop iterated over the array pushing all previous items into an output array , when the index reached the same as the placement ,pushed the value then the array item into the output array , and after that returned the output array.
